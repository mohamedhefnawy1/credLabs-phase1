                        Online publishers seek credentialed experts to review their content for several key reasons. These often include a combination of:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Fact Checking: ensuring factual accuracy and limiting the spread of #fakenews
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Engagement: making content more thorough, nuanced, and interesting to read
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Credibility: increasing reader conversion with more trustworthy authorship
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>
                        - Experts set their own rate per article. This creates a relatively wide range of pricing that depends on the location of the professional(s) you are seeking, their qualifications, and ultimately their work preferences. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - For example, we’ve had a Harvard-educated doctor (MD) request $150 per article reviewed and a Certified Personal Trainer charge only $20. That said, the average rate across our platform hovers around $40/article.

                        - AuthorityGenius currently charges publishers $5 fee per article reviewed.

                    <p>
                        - Experts never pay to be on the platform. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Our fee is not deducted from, but rather tacked on to the per article fee that Experts earn.

                        - Longer articles generally take more time to review, and Experts reviewers work at different paces. That said, the typical turnaround time to review a single article is generally 2 business days.

                        - Our mission is to build a diverse network of professionals to help improve content quality  for as many publishers as possible. That means we accept all kinds of Experts into our community including a wide range of credentials, seniority, geography, and industry experience. Currently there isn’t a minimum level of qualifications to join, although we have primarily focused on recruiting the following kinds of professionals first:

                        - Medical (Physicians, specialist doctors, surgeons, nurse practitioners, dieticians / nutritionists, psychologists) 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, we are in the early days of scaling our network and thus iturrently our Expert database includes mostly the following
