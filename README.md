# credMart-phase1

CredMart is a brand new market place for licesnced professionals to sell their expertise and therefore their credibility to content publishers writing in their field of expertise. Every content publisher would benifit from simpler access to experts. Finding licensed professionals to review online content was difficult until now. 

With CredMart, you now have an open marketplace for experts and publishers to freely buy and sell their services to each other in an easy-to-use and user friendly way.

Today many online publishers / content creators work with doctors and other licensed medical professionals (dieticians, physical therapists, nurses, etc.) to “medically review” content for accuracy. This is not only to limit liability in the event that someone sues you, your page, or your online media business, but also to improve the quality and authority of your work as a whole by having vetted professionals review and analyze your content.

-We are currently in phase 1 which is just the design of the initial landing page and two sign up forms that are being used to test the demand for this kind of market-place.
